# camera2QRcodeReader
Simple to use, real time QR code reader implementation for Android.
Should give you an idea of how to use the new camera2 API for the application that run on Lollipop (API21) and up using the ImageReader's surface target - the camera streams the data through and you can check for a QR code in the real time.
Hopefully it will be handy for some people.<br>
NOTE: it is an experimental one and you should definitely use the idea ONLY and feel free to improve it and make pull requests.
</br> Appreciate any advice or comment.
